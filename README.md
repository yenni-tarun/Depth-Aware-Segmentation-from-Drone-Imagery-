# Depth-Aware Segmentation from Drone Imagery

## 📖 Overview
This project presents a **depth-aware semantic segmentation framework** for aerial images captured by drones. Traditional RGB-based segmentation struggles with **occlusions, shadows, elevation variations, and overlapping structures**, which are common in drone imagery. To address this, we integrate **monocular depth estimation** with **transformer-based semantic segmentation**, enabling the model to leverage both **visual appearance (RGB)** and **geometric depth cues**.

The framework is designed to be **accurate, robust, and computationally efficient**, making it suitable for real-world UAV applications such as **navigation, obstacle detection, urban mapping, and environmental monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 Key Contributions
- A complete **depth-aware segmentation pipeline** combining denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.
- Use of **DPT Hybrid (MiDaS 3.0)** for high-quality monocular depth estimation.
- Extension of **SegFormer** to accept **RGB + Depth (4-channel input)**.
- **Attention-based depth fusion** to dynamically balance RGB and depth features.
- Significant improvement in segmentation accuracy over RGB-only models.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
Drone imagery lacks explicit depth information, making it difficult to distinguish:
- Flat vs elevated structures  
- Overlapping buildings and vegetation  
- Objects under shadows or occlusions  

Depth provides **geometric context**, which improves:
- Boundary clarity  
- Object separation  
- Scene understanding in complex aerial environments

## 🧹 Denoising Module
Drone images often contain noise due to vibration, altitude, and weather conditions.

### Models Evaluated
- **DnCNN** – Strong noise removal but slight over-smoothing  
- **Tiny DnCNN** – Faster but reduced quality  
- **Custom U-Net** – Best balance of noise removal and detail preservation  

✅ **Selected Model:** Custom U-Net

## 📐 Depth Estimation Module
Depth estimation is performed using **monocular RGB images**, removing the need for LiDAR or stereo cameras.

### Models Evaluated
- **DPT Small** – Lightweight and fast  
- **DPT Hybrid (MiDaS 3.0)** – CNN + Transformer hybrid  

✅ **Selected Model:** DPT Hybrid  
It produces smoother depth gradients, sharper boundaries, and lower error metrics.

## 🧩 Segmentation Module
Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel (buildings, roads, vegetation, etc.).

### Models Used
- **DeepLabV3** – Strong on large objects  
- **SegFormer** – Transformer-based, excellent for complex aerial scenes  

✅ **Selected Model:** SegFormer

## 🔀 Depth-Aware Fusion Network
The core innovation of this project is **RGB–Depth fusion**.

### Fusion Strategy
- Input becomes **4-channel (RGB + Depth)**
- **Channel-attention mechanism** dynamically balances feature importance:
  - Depth emphasized in elevated or occluded regions
  - RGB emphasized in flat or texture-rich regions

This improves:
- Boundary precision  
- Object separation  
- Robustness under shadows and clutter
